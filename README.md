# MpExpensesBot

MpExpensesBot is a project of two small C# applications that are designed to run as background processes on a Windows Server.

They will systematically work through a SQL database of MP expenses taken from parliament's data and tweet the expenses at regular intervals.  It will also tag MPs in their own tweets, and respond with a random expense if you mention the bot in a tweet and name an MP.

##Example of tweeting our bot

Using any of the MP names below (name or twitter handle, not constituency) send a tweet like the below.  The text can be anything as long as it contains the MP name
